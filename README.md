# plsql_unit_tester
A plsql unit testing tool I made a long long time ago.

It allows you to write PL/SQL unit tests using PL/SQL.  The xut.pck package contains all the code needed to create and execute unit tests.  Check the package header for documentation as well as the package body of sample_tests for usage instructions.

Unit tests for the unit tester are located in test_xut.pck.
